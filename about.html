        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            I have ADHD. Not the "oh I'm a bit distracted sometimes" kind. The real deal—the kind where you have 47 browser tabs open, three "urgent" projects half-done, and a task list that makes you want to take a nap just looking at it.
        </p>
        <p>
            For years, I tried every productivity app out there. Todoist. Notion. Asana. Trello. Apps with kanban boards. Apps with mind maps. Apps with gamification. Apps that played soothing sounds. Apps that yelled at me.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>None of them worked.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>The Realization</h2>
        <p>
            They all had the same problem: they were built for neurotypical brains. Brains that can:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 1rem 2rem; line-height: 2;">
            <li>Make decisions without spiraling into analysis paralysis</li>
            <li>Start tasks without needing a nuclear reactor's worth of activation energy</li>
            <li>Remember what they were doing after checking one notification</li>
            <li>Work for 25-minute "pomodoros" consistently (seriously, who can do that?)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            But ADHD brains? We need something different. We need:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin: 1rem 0 1rem 2rem; line-height: 2;">
            <li><strong>Radical simplicity</strong> - because every choice is exhausting</li>
            <li><strong>Energy-adaptive systems</strong> - because some days are 15-minute days</li>
            <li><strong>Enforced boundaries</strong> - because "just one more thing" destroys us</li>
            <li><strong>Honest feedback</strong> - not gentle nudges, but real accountability</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>
            So I built FocusHub. Not for everyone. For <em>us</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Three buckets, not seventeen. Sprint timers that adapt to your actual energy, not some arbitrary 25 minutes. An AI system that tells you the truth, not what you want to hear.
        </p>
        <p>
            No gamification. No endless customization. No productivity porn.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Just structure that works for brains that wander.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>The Military Aesthetic</h2>
        <p>
            You'll notice FocusHub has a military/tactical feel. "MISSION CONTROL." "SYSTEM INTELLIGENCE." Monospace fonts and stark contrasts.
        </p>
        <p>
            This isn't random. ADHD brains respond to <strong>external structure</strong> when internal regulation fails. The tactical design creates that structure psychologically. It says: "This is serious. This is a mission. Execute."
        </p>
        <p>
            It works. Trust me, I've tested it on myself for months.
        </p>

        <div class="book-cta">
            <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">The Complete System</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                FocusHub is just one part of the system. I wrote a complete field manual for building your external brain.
            </p>

        <h2>Why "Ronan E. Kane"?</h2>
        <p>
            It's a pen name. Why? Because I wanted to separate my personal identity from the work. This isn't about me—it's about building tools that work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, "Kane" sounds more tactical than my actual name, which sounds like a sitcom character.
        </p>

        <h2>The Mission</h2>
        <p>
            FocusHub isn't trying to be the next billion-dollar startup. It's trying to help people with ADHD actually get their shit done.
        </p>
        <p>
            If that's you, welcome. Let's build something.
