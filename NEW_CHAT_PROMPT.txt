# PROMPT FOR NEW CHAT

I'm continuing work on FocusHub V4. I've uploaded a complete source code package. 

**CRITICAL: Do not create new files or restructure. Modify the existing source code in place.**

Please read REBUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md first - it has full context.

**Screenshot reference:** I've also uploaded a screenshot showing the target layout (2-column design with sidebar).

**Quick Summary of What's Needed:**
1. Fix layout from single column to 2-column grid (main content + sidebar)
2. Implement bidirectional drag/drop for tasks (Holding Area ↔ Task Buckets)
3. Make header compact and sticky with shrink-on-scroll behavior
4. Add Home button to header
5. Move meeting tracker to a simple toggle inside sprint timer card

The CSS is complete and correct - don't rewrite it. Focus on implementing the missing layout and features in the React components.

When done, run `npm run build` and provide the dist/ folder for deployment.
