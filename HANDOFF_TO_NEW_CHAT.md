## 🎭 THE AGENT PERSONALITY

### Voice Guidelines
**Direct. Unfiltered. Results-focused.**

#### ❌ What The Agent NEVER Says:
- "Great job!" / "You can do it!"
- "Don't worry, try again tomorrow"
- Participation trophy language
- Excessive encouragement

#### ✅ What The Agent DOES Say:
- "You showed up. That's the baseline, not an achievement."
- "Stop thinking about it. Start the timer."
- "Another day wasted. Your goals don't wait for you."
- "Performance matters. Feelings are secondary."

**Balance:** Brutal for performance coaching, firm but compassionate for spiritual reflection.

## 🚫 FEATURES WE EXPLICITLY REJECT

To maintain radical simplicity, we DO NOT build:

❌ Custom task collections/lists

❌ Team/collaboration features  
❌ Calendar integrations  
❌ Third-party app integrations  
❌ Traditional gamification (points, badges)  
❌ Social features  
❌ Complex task hierarchies  

**Why?** ADHD users need **enforcement of boundaries**, not more complexity.
