# Simple Screenshot Creation Guide

Since I can't render actual PNG files, here's the **easiest way** for you to get the 5 screenshots:

## Option 1: Just Screenshot Your App (5 minutes)

1. **Go to your deployed app**: https://focushub-6ah.pages.dev/app
2. **Clear localStorage** (open console, run `localStorage.clear()`)
3. **Reload** and click through to each screen
4. **Use Cmd+Shift+4 (Mac)** to capture each screen state
5. **Save to screenshots/ folder**

### The 5 Screens You Need:

1. **Energy Check-In** - The "Prepare your session" screen ✅ (already visible!)
2. **Three Buckets** - Click "Start session" then look at task buckets
3. **Sprint Timer** - Start a sprint, capture the running timer
4. **Distraction Parking** - Click distraction button during sprint
5. **End of Day** - Click "END DAY" button

## Option 2: I'll Create Static HTML Mockups

If you want me to create standalone HTML files that show each screen perfectly (which you can then screenshot), I can do that. These would be:
- Perfect replicas of each screen state
- With realistic data filled in
- Already sized correctly
- Just open in browser and screenshot

Would you like me to create these 5 HTML mockup files?

## My Recommendation

**Just screenshot your working app** - it'll take 5 minutes and will show the REAL thing, not a mockup. The app is already deployed and working!

Let me know which approach you prefer!
