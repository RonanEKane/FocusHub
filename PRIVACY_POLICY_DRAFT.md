## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

FocusHub is built on a simple principle: **your productivity data is yours, not ours**. Unlike other productivity apps that store your tasks forever, analyze your behavior for advertising, or sell your data to third parties, we automatically delete your task text weekly and never share your information with anyone.

This isn't just marketing—it's how we've built the app.

- **Why:** To create your account and enable sync
- **How Long:** Until you delete your account

### **Preferences**

We delete it weekly so you don't have to worry.
