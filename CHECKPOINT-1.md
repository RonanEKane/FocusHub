# Checkpoint 1 - Layout Fixes ✅

## Fixed:
1. Header logo increased from 24px to 40px
2. Tagline now visible (was hidden)
3. Scrolled logo shrinks to 32px (was 20px)
4. AI Agent sidebar removed sticky positioning - now normal column
5. Day Complete screen has "Start New Day" button that properly clears localStorage

## Still Todo (from list):
- [ ] Morning Reflection integration
- [ ] End of Day self-grading with +/- buttons
- [ ] Progress Tracker/Reflection Insights cards
- [ ] Task priority system (already has weights, need UI for setting priority)
- [ ] Baseline minimum sprints
- [ ] Home page with data visualizations
- [ ] Navigation between pages without reset
- [ ] Auto-end day after 2hrs inactivity post-midnight
- [ ] Reopen closed day option
- [ ] Tough love toggle (3 levels)
- [ ] Sprint time normalization factor
