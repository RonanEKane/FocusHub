                <h2>1. Choose Your Energy Level</h2>
                <p>Before starting any sprint, pick Low (15 min), Medium (20 min), or High (30 min). Be honest. Your brain knows the difference between "I slept great" and "third coffee trying to function."</p>
                <div class="pro-tip">
                    <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Starting with Low energy but feeling great after? Upgrade mid-day. Claiming High when you're dragging? You'll crash. The system works when you're honest.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-section">
                <h2>2. Set Your Baseline Sprint Target</h2>
                <p>This is your minimum daily commitment. Default is 5 sprints. Tasks will add to this based on priority. Think of it as your floor, not your ceiling.</p>
                <div class="pro-tip">
                    <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Start conservative. Better to exceed 5 sprints than fail at 10. Build momentum with wins, not guilt from missing targets.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-section">
                <h2>3. Brain Dump Everything</h2>
                <p>Type tasks into the Brain Dump. One at a time or paste a list. Don't organize yet. Just capture. The Holding Area is your external hard drive.</p>
                <div class="pro-tip">
                    <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Dump first, decide later. If it's in your head taking up space, it goes in the dump. Sorting comes after capture.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-section">
                <h2>4. Sort Into Priority Buckets</h2>
                <p>Drag tasks from Holding into three buckets:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>🔥 Urgent (1 sprint):</strong> Quick admin, emails, calls</li>
                    <li><strong>🎯 Deep Work (2 sprints):</strong> Writing, coding, focused creation</li>
                    <li><strong>♟️ Strategic (3 sprints):</strong> Big moves, hard problems, avoidance work</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Watch your sprint target increase automatically as you add tasks.</p>
                <div class="pro-tip">
                    <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Most things are 1-2 sprints. If it's 5+ sprints, break it into smaller tasks. Your brain needs wins, not mountains.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-section">
                <h2>5. Run Your First Sprint</h2>
                <p>Pick a task. Hit the timer button for your energy level. Work until it beeps. No task-switching. No "quick checks." Focus means focus.</p>
                <div class="pro-tip">
                    <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Timer runs even if you switch tabs. That's intentional. You can't hide from the clock. Finish the sprint or log the distraction. No middle ground.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-section">
                <h2>6. Log Distractions Immediately</h2>
                <p>Phone buzz? Coworker interrupt? Thought spiral about dinner? Type it in Distraction Parking. Check "I'll handle this" if you plan to deal with it. This feeds the Intention vs Reality tracker.</p>
                <div class="pro-tip">
                    <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Patterns emerge fast. Three "Slack" distractions by 11am? That's not random. That's a signal. The parking lot shows you where your focus leaks.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-section">
                <h2>7. Choose Your Tough Love Level</h2>
                <p>The AI Agent gives real-time feedback based on your progress. Pick your coaching style:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Supportive:</strong> Encouraging, gentle nudges</li>
                    <li><strong>Balanced:</strong> Realistic assessment, no coddling</li>
                    <li><strong>Tough:</strong> Blunt truth, calls out patterns</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="pro-tip">
                    <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Try all three. Some days you need support. Other days you need someone to tell you to stop scrolling and get to work.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-section">
                <h2>8. Track Your Progress</h2>
                <p>Today's Progress card shows sprints completed, tasks done, and distractions logged. The Current Grade updates in real-time based on your performance.</p>
                <div class="pro-tip">
                    <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Grade drops with distractions (5% penalty each). Three distractions = 15% grade drop. The system doesn't lie about where your focus went.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-section">
                <h2>9. Use Meeting Tracker</h2>
                <p>Click "Meeting" button when you enter a meeting. Clock starts. Click again when done. Meeting time is tracked separately from sprint time.</p>
                <div class="pro-tip">
                    <strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you're in 4 hours of meetings, your sprint target shouldn't be 8. The system tracks meeting reality so you can plan accordingly.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-section">
                <h2>10. Grade Your Day (End of Day)</h2>
                <p>Hit END DAY when you're done. System shows its grade. You choose yours using letter buttons (A+, A, A-, B+, B, etc.). Write a reflection if you want. Then complete the day.</p>
                <div class="pro-tip">
                    <strong>Pro tip:</strong> One C doesn't matter. Five Cs in a row is a pattern. The Mission Control dashboard shows your weekly rhythm. Use it to spot slips before they become spirals.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-section">
                <h2>11. Check Mission Control Dashboard</h2>
                <p>Visit the home page to see your cumulative stats: total sprints, day streak (B+ or better), performance index, and Intention vs Reality gap.</p>
                <div class="pro-tip">
                    <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Weekly chart shows your consistency. One bad day in a streak of good ones? You're fine. Three bad days in a row? Time to reassess your baseline or task estimates.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="guide-section">
                <h2>12. Complete Tasks, Track Wins</h2>
                <p>Check the box on any task to complete it. It moves to Today's Wins automatically. Visual proof you're not failing, even when it feels like it.</p>
                <div class="pro-tip">
                    <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Finished 2 tasks but feel like you did nothing? Check your wins list. Your brain lies about productivity. The list doesn't.
